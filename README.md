    Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a firm that creates individualized financial plans for their customers, they hired us to develop a program and to mitigate associated risks and produce a encryption service for their data.  
    
    What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
We were able to isolate and determine the ricks involved with the code and with the system overall, these were then reduced further by reducing false alarms and the remainging were reduced by reveiwing and implimenting code changes. 
    
    What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
Working with Maven at first was confusing as I have not seen it before and working with some missing information when first setting up the system was challenging but I was eventually able to move past it. 

    How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
Reveiwing code and making sure to mitigate risks with my code should be a idea in my mind from the start when creating or producing a product regardless if there is testing, as this testing could miss important factors. 
    
    How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I revewed and compared my vunerabilities to the ones made before my changes then evaluated them to see if these were true threats or if they were false alarms.
    
    What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Useing the internet and past experiences with encryption services was a huge help when understanding how it interacts with the user and how these encryption service function 
    
    Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  I would elaborate on how, when and why I mad changes to my code to reduce the total number of threats and how the new threats, if not false, were mitigated.
